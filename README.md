## Small Fun Projects

I use this repo to try out small fun projects and keep samples of code I liked.

Some of them are live here:


### [Movie API](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/Movie_API/index.html "Movie API")
Using the API from [The Movie Database](https://api.themoviedb.org), following a tutorial from Brad Traversy.


### [Analog Clock](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/JS_Clock_2.0/index.html)
I build this clock because I liked the styling so much.
Props to [Tommy Kelly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBeE2qKffzEzRoWns6RZ8UA/videos) for that.

### [Expanding Cards](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/flowers/index.html)

Based on a project from Brad Traversy's course on Udemy: "50 projects in 50 days".

### [Animated Placeholders](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/Animated_Placeholders/index.html)

Input fields with placeholders that become labels when you click inside. 
Pure CSS. 🤓
Scratched this together from a couple of sources.

### [Basic Animated CSS Loader](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/Loaders/index.html)

Well. It *is* basic.
Animation with @keyframes.
      
### [CSS Only Accordion](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/CSS_only_Accordion/index.html)

When building the website for [Hamburg Coding School](https://hamburgcodingschool.com) my boss kept hassling me to find a *CSS only* solution, so to not slow down the site. 
Just starting out back then I thought it couldn't be done. 
Thank you for the push, Teresa! &#129303;
