# Small Fun Projects

I use this repo to try out some fun projects and keep samples of code I like.

Some of them are live here:

### [Interesting Buttons](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/Buttons "Interesting Buttons")

I enjoy interesting hover effects. Still collecting...

### [Loading Animations (CSS only)](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/Loaders "Loading Animations (CSS only)")

Animations with @keyframes.

### [Drawing App](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/Drawing_App "Drawing App")

Draw on canvas with various colors and download your creation.

### [Fun with Forms](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/Fun_with_Forms "Fun with Forms")

- Animated Placeholders
- fieldset & legend
- optgroup
- accent-color

### [Mobile Delights](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/Mobile_Delights "Mobile Delights")

- the inputmode attribute to display the appropiate keyboard

### [Fun with Images](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/Fun_with_Images "Fun with Images")
- background-blend-mode

### [Nifty Bits and Bobs](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/Nifty_Bits_and_Bobs "Nifty Bits and Bobs")

Mostly tiny things I come across that I find interesting. For example:
- HTML only Accordion
- Typing Effect
- Conic Gradient
- Pie Chart with Conic Gradient
- 'resize' property
- 'filter: hue-rotate()'
- flip animations
- text transformations
      
### [Accordion (CSS Only)](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/CSS_only_Accordion "Accordion (CSS only)")

When building the website for [Hamburg Coding School](https://hamburgcodingschool.com) my boss kept pushing me to find a *CSS only* solution, so to not slow down the site. 

Just starting out back then I thought it couldn't be done. 

Thank you for the push, Teresa! &#129303;

### [3D Magic (CSS only)](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/3D-Rotating-Perspective-Awesomeness)

Just coded along with a great tutorial.

All honors for this one go to [Amit Sheen](https://amitsh.com/) and [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/). üôè


### [Image Comparison Slider (CSS only)](https://codemon72.github.io/Small-Fun-Projects/Image_Comparison_Slider "Image Comparison Slider (CSS only")
2 images positioned above each other, using the 'resize: horizontal;' property on the top one.
